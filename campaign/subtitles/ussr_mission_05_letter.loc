mySubtitles.Sub2.myText	\nNo, Sasha, I am not dead. Much to your father's chagrin, I imagine. We have been constantly on the move and to find even a few minutes of peace has been well nigh impossible...
mySubtitles.Sub3.myText	\nFather has been asking about you. I think he is genuinely concerned, though I know you don't believe me. I sometimes doubt that you believe anything I say...
mySubtitles.Sub4.myText	\nYour father would like Vladimir's nephew Nikolai - the man's idealism and zeal rivals that of the most fervent religious believer. Poor boy. One day he will realize the sham of it all...
mySubtitles.Sub5.myText	\nHow is old Vladimir? You know I hold him in high regard, but please ask him to speed things up and win this damn war. I'm sick and tired of the constant shortages...
mySubtitles.Sub6.myText	\nOf course. If I just ask Volodja, he will win the war for us in an instant. Not a problem, my dear...
mySubtitles.Sub7.myText	\nAnd listen to Vladimir. He has at least a semblance of morals compared to you, my dear. And don't die on me. Who would I then quarrel with? Your, Alexandra.
