Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(0)	[006.2-013.7] I suggest... we fortify these crossings... and then blow up the bridge.
Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(1)	[013.8-17.4] Yeah, that should buy Wilkins some time.\nThat won't work sir, we don't have nearly enough men-
Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(2)	[017.5-026.5] And what would you have us do!? Roll over and die? \nIf Ivan gets to Fort Teller we'll have a global thermonuclear war on our hands.
Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(3)	[027.3-028.7] Must be a Russian scout.
Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(4)	[028.8-031.1] \nDammit, we need to get moving.

Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(6)	[035.9-037.4] Understood sir.
Cine1.myPresentation.M04F01.mySubTitles.LOCTEXT(7)	[037.5-042.0] Alright then. Wilkins is counting on us. Let's get to it.
